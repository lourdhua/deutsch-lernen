Adverbs in German do not change based on tense, pronoun, or case. Unlike adjectives, which adjust their endings based on gender, case, and number, adverbs remain in their base form regardless of the grammatical context. 
Here's a breakdown of how adverbs are used:

### Adverbs and Their Characteristics

1. **Invariance**: 
   - Adverbs maintain their form across different contexts. They do not inflect or change endings based on grammatical factors.

2. **Usage**:
   - **Temporal Adverbs**: Indicate time (e.g., *schnell* - quickly, *bald* - soon).
   - **Modal Adverbs**: Indicate manner or degree (e.g., *sehr* - very, *gerne* - gladly).
   - **Locational Adverbs**: Indicate place or direction (e.g., *hier* - here, *dort* - there).

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Consistency**: 
   - Adverbs do not adjust for gender, number, or case.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - They can be placed in various positions within a sentence but typically follow certain patterns depending on the emphasis or context.

3. **Sentence Position**:
   - **Temporal Adverbs**: Often found at the beginning or end of a sentence.
   - **Modal Adverbs**: Can be positioned before or after the main verb depending on emphasis.
   - **Locational Adverbs**: Typically follow the main clause or verb phrase.

By understanding that adverbs are invariant, you can focus on their meaning and placement in sentences to convey the right nuance without worrying about inflection rules.
